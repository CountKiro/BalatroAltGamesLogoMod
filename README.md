# Kiro's Logo Collection
A Balatro mod that adds 45 different main menu variation, all based on popular (or not so popular) games, with custom logo, background and button colours.

List of logos currently added/planned and credits can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QO0SCm5uRwIDvHhKLLEfka8OZTCZm46x84786ckKLw0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

## Installing the mod

1. Download and install, [Steammodded 1.0.0 beta 1224a](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta-1224a) and [Lovely v0.7.1](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)
2. Download the  GameLogoMod_v0.3.0.zip  file from [Releases](https://github.com/CountKiro/BalatroAltGamesLogoMod/releases/tag/v0.3) on the right menu, extract it and then place it in your Mods folder. You'll know it's correct if you open the GameLogoMod folder and there's an assets folder and a .lua and .json file inside
3. [OPTIONAL] Download the Music Addon and install it just like Step 3
4. [OPTIONAL] Go to Mods -> Game Logo Mod -> Options -> change the settings if you want a fixed logo or randomized
